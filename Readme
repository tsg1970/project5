Mchenry Restaurants version 1.0 8/01/2015

email: tsgoff@att.net

The webpage shows the location of 15 restaurants in the Mchenry area and 
places a marker on a Google map where each restaurant is located.

The site uses the Foursquare api to retrieve a list of restaurants. For each 
restaurant the page retrieves the restaurant's name, address, and url. Each 
marker has an infowindow that appears when the marker is clicked. 

The search input box will filter through the list with each letter typed. 
As each letter is typed the markers on the map will coordinate with the search 
list.

When a marker is clicked or selected from the list view the marker will bounce and
the infowindow will appear.

To start the application, open the file index.html with any browser. A list of 15 
restaurants will appear along with a Google map showing the location of each 
restaurant. In the search box enter any string to narrow the list of
restaurants. Click on any marker to open a window the shows the details of 
the restaurant. If there is a Foursquare URL there will be a link to the restaurant 
in the window. Click on the link to take you to the restaurants webpage.
