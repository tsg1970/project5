Mchenry Restaurants
I created a page that shows the location of 15 restaurants in the Mchenry area and 
places a marker on a Google map where each restaurant is located.

I used Foursquare to retrieve the list of restaurants. I retrieved the restaurants name, address, and url. Each marker
has an infowindow that shows when the marker is clicked. 

The search input box will filter through the list with each letter typed. As each letter is typed the markers on the map
will coordinate with the search list.
